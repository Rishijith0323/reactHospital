                                    The digital revolution that has dramatically changed society and India is at the forefront of this movement. For a variety of reasons, despite the enormous volumes of data generated in healthcare and the sometimes life-and-death nature of the field, healthcare systems and providers have been slow to adopt information technology as an adjunct to help them manage data to the best advantage. AIMS is a leader in healthcare education, research and information technology and seeks to build on this foundation of expertise to address crucial problems of healthcare organisation, delivery and outcomes assessment that exist in India today by starting a Centre for Digital Health based at the Kochi campus of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

                                    AIMS intends to be a leader in imparting state-of-the-art education to learners at all levels of training and wishes to attract the best students and faculty to our institution.. In pursuit of this goal, AIMS has established the CDH which is a centre of excellence for the provision of multidisciplinary medical education of an international standard. If focuses on improving patient care at the bedside by a judicious combination of enhanced basic and advanced clinical skills, procedural aptitude, development of electronic medical records and the use of point-of-care decision support modalities. These facilities are available not only to the students and faculty of AIMS, but also to trainees and physicians from elsewhere in India and abroad.

                                    The following components of CDH function synergistically to build outstanding programs in medical training, procedural skills, applied medical informatics, continuing medical education, clinical practice, research and medical humanities.
